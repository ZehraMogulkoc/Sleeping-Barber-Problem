In this project, it was aimed to find a solution to the sleeping barber problem.

It is enough to type "make" to run the code. 
Following command will be running:

gcc barber.c -o run -pthread
	./run 25 50 100 50 10
	
It takes a little time to terminate. The solution is nt deadlock-free and it is not completely true but the logic should be as it is.
